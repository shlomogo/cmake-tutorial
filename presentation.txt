- disclaimer:
    - not covering all of cmake
    - examples may contain non best practices

- cmake introduction
    - meta build system
    - build system (ninja, make)
    - appendix:
        - compiler vs linker
        - pipeline: preprocessor, compiler, assembler, linker

- cmake language
    - demo

- calculator:
    - calculator executable
    - demonstrate the following:
        - cmake .. -G "Ninja"           --> ninja
        - cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles"  --> make
        - cmake ..                      --> cmake --build .

- calculator with math lib:
    - break down the calculator into executable and math library

- calculator with math lib using interface:
    - use add_subdirectory and a new cmake file
    - expose math library header via interface

- calculator configure_file for version:
    - add calculator version info using configure_file

- calculator int and float:
    - break down the math library into int and float libraries
    - create a math wrapper for the calculator
    - choose the math library via cmake or command-line

- calculator tester:
    - introduce a tester executable to test the math libraries

- calculator tester lib per test:
    - split the tests into smaller pieces (lib per test)
    - introduce tester.cmake infrastructure (using include command)
    - link tests to tester

- calculator tester test list property:
    - link tests to the tester using a dedicated test-list property, to reduce
      manual steps on new tests

- calculator tester test list autogen:
    - link tests to the tester via the infrastructure function - even cleaner
    - auto generate an array of tests from the dedicated test-list property
    - change the tester to consume the auto-generated file
    - demo adding a new test 'test_mix'

- calculator tester test list autogen with custom targets:
    - main change: multiple autogen files including headers!
    - mark autogen c file as generated
    - create custom autogen target
    - explicitly depend tester on autogen target
    - tester code changes
    - show the dependency graph:
        - cmake .. --graphviz=graph.dot
        - dot -Tpng graph.dot -o graph.png
